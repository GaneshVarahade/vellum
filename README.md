At some stage, commmon utilities were copied to <a href="https://github.com/evanx/vellumcore">github.com/evanx/vellumcore</a>, as a dependency for other projects.

Also <a href="https://github.com/evanx/vellum/tree/master/src/dualcontrol">dualcontrol</a> code was copied to <a href="https://github.com/evanx/dualcontrol">github.com/evanx/dualcontrol</a>. However it is possible that more recent changes to that code were made here, for the purposes of the <a href="https://github.com/evanx/vellum/wiki/DualControl">Dual Control</a> article.
